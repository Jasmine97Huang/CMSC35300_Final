6,"What's the matter with the clothes I'm wearing?
""Can't you tell that your tie's too wide?""
Maybe I should buy some old tab collars?
""Welcome back to the age of jive.

Where have you been hidin' out lately, honey?
You can't dress trashy till you spend a lot of money.""
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me

What's the matter with the car I'm driving?
""Can't you tell that it's out of style?""
Should I get a set of white wall tires?
""Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile?

Nowadays you can't be too sentimental
Your best bet's a true baby blue Continental.""
Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk
It's still rock and roll to me

Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers
'Cause it's always been the same old scene
There's a new band in town
But you can't get the sound from a story in a magazine
Aimed at your average teen

How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants?
""You could really be a Beau Brummel baby
If you just give it half a chance.

Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers.""
Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me

(Alright, Rico)
Wooh, wooh

Ooh, what's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?
""Don't you know that they're out of touch?""
Should I try to be a straight A student?
""If you are then you think too much.

Don't you know about the new fashion honey?
All you need are looks and a whole lotta money.""

My body's weak
I'm on the run
No time to sleep
I've got to ride
Ride like the wind
To be free again

And I've got such a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind

I was born the son of a lawless man
Always spoke my mind with a gun in my hand
Lived nine lives
Gunned down ten
Gonna ride like the wind

And I've got such a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind

Accused and tried and told to hang
I was nowhere in sight when the church bells rang
Never was the kind to do as I was told
Gonna ride like the wind before I get old

It is the night

26,"Evryone considered him the coward of the county
He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong
His mama named him Tommy; the folks just called him 'Yellow'
But something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong

He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison
I looked after Tommy 'cause he was my brother's son
I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy
""Son, my life is over, but yours is just begun""

""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you dont have to fight to be a man""

There's someone for everyone, and Tommy's love was Becky
In her arms, he didn't have to prove he was a man
One day, while he was workin', the Gatlin boys came callin'
They took turns at Becky; there was three of them

Tommy opened up the door and saw his Becky cryin'
The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand
He reached above the fireplace and took down his daddy's picture
As his tears fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again:

""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you dont have to fight to be a man""

The Gatlin boys just laughed at him when he walked into the barroom
One of them got up and met him halfway 'cross the floor
When Tommy turned around they said, ""Hey look! Ol' yellow's leavin'""
But you coulda heard a pin drop when Tommy stopped and blocked the door

Twenty years of crawlin' was bottled up inside him
He wasn't holdin nothin' back; he let 'em have it all
When Tommy left the barroom, not a Gatlin boy was standin'
He said, ""This one's for Becky,"" as he watched the last one fall
And I heard him say

""I promised you, dad, not to do the things you done
I walk away from trouble when I can
Now please dont think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek
And papa, I sure hope you understand
Sometimes you gotta fight when youre a man""

Sailing on the cool and bright clear water

Even rode my motorcycle in the rain

Alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
You were lonely for a man
I said take me as I am
'Cause you might enjoy some madness for a while

Now think of all the years you tried to
Find someone to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as you say
If I'm crazy then it's true
That it's all because of you
And you wouldn't want me any other way

Oh, what you might have been if you'd have had more time

In the corner of your room
And look how far we've come
So far from where we used to be

How it was before

They're talkin' about you and it's bringin' me down

We're traveling light today,
In the eye of the storm...in the eye of the storm
Home...to a new and a shiny place
Make our bed and we'll say our grace

The snow was falling Christmas Eve
I stole behind her in the frozen foods
And I touched her on the sleeve

She didn't recognize the face at first
But then her eyes flew open wide
She went to hug me and she spilled her purse
And we laughed until we cried

We took her groceries to the checkout stand
The food was totaled up and bagged
We stood there lost in our embarrassment
As the conversation dragged

Went to have ourselves a drink or two
But couldn't find an open bar
We bought a six-pack at the liquor store
And we drank it in her car

We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to now
And tried to reach beyond the emptiness
But neither one knew how

She said she'd married her an architect
Who kept her warm and safe and dry
She would have liked to say she loved the man
But she didn't like to lie

I said the years had been a friend to her
And that her eyes were still as blue
But in those eyes I wasn't sure if I
Saw doubt or gratitude

She said she saw me in the record stores
And that I must be doing well
I said the audience was heavenly
But the traveling was hell

We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to now
And tried to reach beyond the emptiness
But neither one knew how

We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to time
Reliving in our eloquence
Another 'auld lang syne'

The beer was empty and our tongues were tired
And running out of things to say
She gave a kiss to me as I got out
And I watched her drive away

Just for a moment I was back at school
And felt that old familiar pain
And as I turned to make my way back home
The snow turned into rain",1981,1980s

Where will I be tomorrow?

Was there a moment when I cut you down?
Played around?
What have I done?!
I only apologize
For being, as they say, the last to know
It has to show
When someone is in your eyes...

What, what kind of fool
Tears it apart
Leaving me pain and sorrow?
Losing you now
Wondering why
Where will I be tomorrow?

Well they give me all kinds of warnings to save me from ruin
When I say that I'm O.K. well they look at me kind of strange
Surely you're not happy now you no longer play the game
People say I'm lazy dreaming my life away
Well they give me all kinds of advice designed to enlighten me
When I tell them that I'm doing fine watching shadows on the wall
Don't you miss the big time boy you're no longer on the ball

I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round
I really love to watch them roll
No longer riding on the merry-go-round
I just had to let it go

Ah, people asking questions lost in confusion
Well I tell them there's no problem, only solutions
Well they shake their heads and they look at me as if I've lost my mind
I tell them there's no hurry
I'm just sitting here doing time

I found out those bright lights aint where I belong
From a phone booth in the rain I called to tell her

I keep on callin' her name
Smokey Mountain rain I'll keep on searchin'
I can't go on hurtin' this way
She's somewhere in the Smokey Mountain rain

He said that he was goin' as far as Gatlinburg
I climbed up in the cab all wet and cold and lonely
I wiped my eyes and told him about her
I've got to find her!

Of facing rainy days
And somehow we survive

We keep the feelings warm
Protect them from the storm
Until our time arrives

Then one day the sun appears
And we come shining through those lonely years

I made it through the rain
I kept my world protected
I made it throught the rain
I kept my point of view
I made it through the rain
And found myself respected
By the others who
Got rained on too
And made it through

When friends are hard to find
And life seems so unkind
Sometimes you feel afraid

Just aim beyond the clouds
And rise above the crowds
And start your own parade

'Cause when I chased my fears away
That's when I knew that I could finally say

I made it through the rain
I kept my world protected
I made it throught the rain
I kept my point of view
I made it through the rain
And found myself respected
By the others who
Got rained on too
And made it through...

His hands were meant for different work and his heart was known to none.
He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
And he gave to me a gift I know I never can repay.

A quiet man of music, denied a simpler fate,
He tried to be a soldier once but his music wouldn't wait.
He earned his love through discipline, a thund'ring, velvet hand.
His gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand

The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul.
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man.
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band.

My brothers' lives were different, for they heard another call.
One went to Chicago and the other to Saint Paul
And I'm in Colorado, when I'm not in some hotel
Living out this life I've chosen, come to know so well.

I thank you for the music and your stories of the road
I thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go
I thank you for the kindness and the times when you got tough
And, Papa, I don't think I said ""I love you"" near enough.

Hiding somewhere in the nights

Silent tears full of pride

Made of stone

Close my eyes, feel the rhythm
Wrap around, take a hold of my heart

Being's believing
I can have it all
Now I'm dancing for my life

Take your passion
And make it happen
Pictures come alive
You can dance right through your life

Now I hear the music
Close my eyes, I am rhythm

I can have it all

When she can't be with you
Tell her you wish you were there

Tell her about it
Everyday before you leave
Pay her some attention
Give her something to believe

'Cause now and then she'll get to worrying
Just because you haven't spoken for so long
And though you may not have done anything
Will that be a consolation when she's gone

Listen boy
It's good information from a man who's made mistakes
Just a word or two that she gets from you
Could be the difference that it makes

She's a trusting soul
She's put her trust in you
But a girl like that
Won't tell you what you should do

Tell her about it
Tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason
To accept that you're for real

Tell her about it
Tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her
Let her know how much she means

Tell her about it
Tell her how you feel right now
Just tell her about it

You got to tell her about it
Tell her now and you won't go wrong
You got to tell her about it

You have to let that raga drop

Has been shaken to the top

He went a-cruisin' down the ville
The muezzin was a-standin'
On the radiator grille

Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah
The sharif don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah

We ban that boogie sound
Degenerate the faithful
With that crazy Casbah sound

But the Bedouin they brought out
The electric kettle drum
The local guitar picker
Got his guitar picking thumb

Had cleared the square
They began to wail

The sharif don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah
The sharif don't like it

Now over at the temple
Oh, they really pack 'em in
The in crowd say it's cool
To dig this chanting thing

But as the wind changed direction
And the temple band took five
The crowd caught a whiff
Of that crazy Casbah jive!

He said you better earn your pay
Drop your bombs between the minarets
Down the Casbah way

The jet pilots tuned to the cockpit radio blare
As soon as the sharif was outta their hair
The jet pilots wailed

Of diving in too deep
And possibly the complications

I worry over situations
I know will be all right
Perhaps it's just imagination

Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear
Ghosts appear and fade away

Alone between the sheets
Only brings exasperation
It's time to walk the streets
Smell the desperation
At least there's pretty lights
And though there's little variation
It nullifies the night
From overkill

And when they said come dancing
My sister always did

My sister should have come in at midnight
And my mom would always sit up and wait
It always ended up in a big row
When my sister used to get home late

Out of my window I could see them in the moonlight
Two silhouettes saying good nights by the garden gate

What are you doing out there?
Come on! Are you gonna be out there all night?

The day they knocked down the palais
My sister stood and cried
The day they knocked down the palais
Part of my childhood died, just died

Now I'm grown up and playing in a band
And there's a car park where the palais used to stand
My sister's married, and she lives on an estate
Her daughters go out, now it's her turn to wait
She knows they get away with things she never could
But if I asked her, I wonder if she would

Come dancing
Come on, sister, have yourself a ball
Don't be afraid to come dancing
It's only natural

Come dancing
Just like the palais on a Saturday
And all her friends would come dancing
While the big bands used to play",1983,1980s

Doing you a favor
I hardly knew you were there

You had every reason
You know I can't blame you
For running to him

I was spreading
My love too thin

I'm still trying to be shaken
Doing much better

The plan was we would share,

But when the music changed
The plan was re-arranged
He went to dance with someone else.

We started dancing and love put us into a groove
But now he's with somebody new
What does love want me to do?

Love said:

Let the music play
He won't get away,
Just keep the groove and then he'll come back to you again, let it play.
Let the music play
He won't get away,
This groove he can't ignore, he won't leave you anymore, no, no, no.

He's dancing his way back to me.
Guess he's discovered we are truly lovers,
Magic from the very start, 'cause love just kept me groovin',

And he felt me movin' even though we danced apart.

When every single word makes sense

And it feels so good to hurt so bad
And suffer just enough to sing the blues

Right from the starting line

I don't need any more advice

And one's just hanging on

Just keep going strong

Can't stop myself, out of control

Looks like the whole world's out of sync

Been running so hard
When what I need is to unwind
The voice of reason
Is one I left so far behind
I've waited so long
So long to play this part
And just remembered
That I'd forgotten about my heart

You got your hair combed back and your sunglasses on, baby

Out on the road today, I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said, ""don't look back, you can never look back""
I thought I knew what love was, what did I know?
Those days are gone forever, I should just let them go, but

I can see you, your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got the top pulled down and the radio on, baby

Save some light for me
Figures up ahead
Moving in the trees

White skin in linen
Perfume on my wrist
And the full moon that hangs over
These dreams in the mist

Darkness on the edge
Shadows where I stand (shadows where I stand)
I search for the time
On a watch with no hands

I want to see you clearly
Come closer than this (all I remember)
But all I remember
Are the dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away (further I'm away)

Is it cloak and dagger
Could it be spring or fall?
I walk without a cut
Through a stained glass wall

(Weaker in my eyesight) Weaker in my eyesight
The candle in my grip (words that have no form)
And words that have no form
Are falling from my lips

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away (further I'm away)

There's something out there
I can't resist
I need to hide away from the pain
There's something out there
I can't resist

The sweetest song is silence
That I've ever heard
Funny how your feet
In dreams never touch the earth

In a wood full of princes
Freedom is a kiss (prince hides his face)
But the prince hides his face
From dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away",1986,1980s

If I'd run away
I'd never have the strength to go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart?
Will it grow cold, the secret that I hide? 
Will I grow old?
How will they hear?
When will they learn?
How will they know?

They can't disguise the truth
That there is something about you

No one can say that we didn't feel
A million things
And a perfect dream of life
Gone, fragile but free
We remain tender together

I try to be discreet
But then blow it again

I've lost and found, it's my final mistake
She's loving by proxy, no give and all take
'Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy
One too many times

From the air until they play the last song

And I think about her when I hear that whistle blow
I can't change my mind

Can they find their way home?
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there

And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care for me, ooh baby

I've been around enough to know
That dreams don't turn to gold
And that there is no easy way
No, you just can't run away

And what we had was so much more
Than we ever had before
And no matter how I try
You're always on my mind

So here I am

You're my angel, come and make it all right

Without your love, a dog without a bone

See what's become of me

For my possibilities
I was so hard to please

Look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky
Is a Hazy Shade of Winter

Hear the Salvation Army Band
Down by the riverside
It's bound to be a better ride
Than what you've got planned
Carry a cup in your hand

Look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky
Is a Hazy Shade of Winter

Hang onto your hopes my friend
That's an easy thing to say
But if your hopes should pass away
Simply pretend
That you can build them again

Look around
Grass is high
Fields are ripe
It's the springtime of my life

Seasons change with their scenery
Weaving time in a tapestry
Won't you stop and remember me

Look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky
Is a Hazy Shade of Winter

They crawled out of the woodwork

They set you on the treadmill

The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died

Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

There's always somebody tempting you
Somebody into doing something they know is wrong

Live with the bottle, that's the way it is

His body's too young, to look like his

Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

Introduce myself as Loc she said ""You're a liar""

Took her to the hotel she said ""You're the king""
I said ""Be my queen if you know what I mean and let us do the wild thing

I said ""Hopefully if things go well I'll be with you tonight""
So we journeyed to her house one thing led to an other
I keyed the door we cold hit the floor looked up and it was her mother

The sweet young miss go gave me a kiss and I knew that she was mine
Took her to the limousine still parked outside
I tipped the chauffeur when it was over and I gave her my own ride
Couldn't get her off my jock she was like static cling
But that's what happens when body start slappin' from doin' the wild thing

Doin' a little show at the local discotheque
This fine young chick was on my jock so I say what the heck
She want to come on stage and do her little dance
So I said chill for now but maybe later you'll get your chance
So when the show was finished I took her around the way
And what do you know she was good to go without a word to say 
We was all alone and she said ""Tone let me tell you one thing 
I need fifty dollars to make you holler 
I get paid to do the wild thing""

A chick walks by you wish you could sex her
But you're standin' on the wall like you was Poindexter

Next day's function, high class luncheon
Food is served and you're stone cold munchin'
Music comes on, people start to dance
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants

A girl starts walkin', guys start gawkin'
Sits down next to you and starts talkin'
Says she wanna dance 'cause she likes the groove
So come on, fatso, and just bust a move

(Oh, huh, yeah, huh, oh huh, yeah, huh)
Just bust a move
(Huh yeah, huh yeah, uh huh yeah huh)

You're on a mission and you're wishin'
Someone could cure your lonely condition
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
No fine girls, just ugly faces

From frustration, first inclination
Is to become a monk and leave the situation
But every dark tunnel has a lighter hope
So don't hang yourself with a celibate rope

New movie's showin', so you're goin'
Could care less about the five you're blowin'
Theater gets dark just to start the show
Then you spot a fine woman sittin' in your row

She's dressed in yellow, she says ""Hello,
Come sit next to me, you fine fellow!""

Got no money and you got no car
Then you got no woman and there you are

Some girls are sadistic, materialistic
Looking for a man makes them opportunistic

In five days from now he's gonna marry
He's hopin' you can make it there if you can
'Cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man

You say neato, check your libido
And roll to the church in your new tuxedo
The bride walks down just to start the wedding
And there's one more girl you won't be getting

So you start thinkin', then you start blinkin'
A bride maid looks and thinks that you're winkin'
She thinks you're kinda cute so she winks back
And now you're feelin' really firm 'cause the girl is stacked

Reception's jumpin', bass is pumpin'
Look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin'
Says she wants to dance to a different groove

I'm a humming and a strumming all over god's world
You can't remember when you got your last meal
And you don't know just how a woman feels

You didn't know what rock and roll was
Until you met my drummer on a grey tour bus
I got there in the nick of time
Before he got his hands across your state line

Now it's the middle of the night on the open road
And the heater don't work and it's oh so cold
You're looking tired, you're looking kind of beat
The rhythm of the street sure knocks you off your feet

You didn't know how rock and roll looked
Until you caught your sister with the guys from the group
Half way home in the parking lot
By the look in her eye she was giving what she got

There's blood on my amp and my Les Paul's beat
Can't keep you home, you're messing around

You didn't know that rock and roll burned
So you bought a candle and you lived and you learned
You got the rhythm you got the speed

You told me I was the only one

Cold coolin' at a bar, and I'm lookin' for some action
But like Mick Jagger said, ""I can't get no satisfaction""
The girls are all around, but none of them want to get with me
My threds are fresh and I'm looking def
Yo, what's up with L-O-C?
The girls I sawjokin' at the other end of the bar
Havin' drinks with some no-name chump
When they know that I'm the star
So I got up and strolled over to the other side of the cantina
I asked the guy, ""Why you so fly?""
He said, ""Funky Cold Medina""

Funky Cold Medina

This brother told me a secret on how to get more chicks
Put a little Medina in your glass
And the girls will come real quick
It's better than any alcohol or aphrodisiac
A couple of sips of this love potion and she'll be on your lap
So I gave some to my dog, when he began to beg
Then he licked his bowl and he looked at me
And did the Wild Thing on my leg
He used to scratch and bite me
Before he was much, much meaner
But now all the poodles run to my house
For the Funky cold Medina

You know what I'm sayin'? I got every dog in my neighborhood
Breakin' down my door, I got Spuds McKenzie, Alex from Stroh's
They won't leave my dog alone with that Medina, pal

I went up to this girl, she said, ""Hi, my name is Sheena""
I thought she'd be good to go with a little Funky cold Medina
She said, ""I'd like a drink, "" I said OK, I'd go get it
Then a couple of sips, she sold licked her lips
And I knew that she was with it
So I took her to my crib, and everything went well as planned
But when she got undressed, it was a big old mess
Sheena was a man
So I threw him out, I don't fool around
With in Oscar Meyer weiner
You must be sure that your girl is pure
For the Funky Cold Medina
You know, ain't no playin' with a man
This is the 80's and I'm down with the ladies, ya know?

Break it down

Back in the saddle, lookin' for a little affection
I took a shot as a conteatant on the Love Connection
The audience voted and you lnow they picked a winner
I took my date to the Hilton for Medina and some dinner
She had a few drinks, I'm thinkin' soon what I'll be gettin'
Instead she started talkin' about plans for a weddin'
Said wait, slow down, love, not so fast, says ""I'll be seein' ya""
That's why I found you don't play around
With the Funky Cold Medina
Ya know what I'm sayin', that Medina's a monster, y'all

And rolled beneath a deep blue sky
Didn't have a care in the world
With mommy and daddy standin' by

But ""happily ever after"" fails
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales

Since Daddy had to fly

Oh, but I know a place where we can go
Still untouched by men
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass waves in the wind

You can lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence

O beautiful, for spacious skies
But now those skies are threatening
They're beating plowshares into swords
For this tired old man that we elected king

Armchair warriors often fail
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers clean up all details
Since Daddy had to lie

Oh, but I know a place where we can go
And wash away this sin
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass waves in the wind

Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair spill all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence

Now we've come so far, so fast
But somewhere back there in the dust
That same small town in each of us

I need to remember this
So baby give me just one kiss
And let me take a long last look
Before we say goodbye

Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
This is the end
This is the end of the innocence
