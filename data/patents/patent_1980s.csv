4926,433337,1980s,"A linear array of injection diode lasers formed on a common substrate is utilized to provide modulated scanning beams for a photosensitive medium. A scanning device, preferably a multifaceted mirror polygon driven at a constant speed, is placed in the optical path between the array and the photosensitive medium, as is a focusing lens. To provide additive exposure intensity the plane of the emitting surface of the array is oriented relative to the scanning device so that all of the beams emitted by the array are caused to illuminate the same scan line of the photosensitive medium whereby each beam scans the same data spots on the same line of the photosensitive medium such that additive exposure of those spots is achieved. Alternatively, each laser of an array of N lasers could be used to expose only 1/N spots across a scan line thereby lowering the duty cycle for each laser whereby the pulse power emission from each laser can be increased so that one diode laser can provide the required exposure intensity at the photosensitive medium. In those instances where a single laser can expose each spot of a scan line of a photosensitive medium with the required exposure intensity for that photosensitive medium, the emitting surface of the array can be oriented relative to the scanning device so that each beam emitted by an array of N lasers illuminates a different scan line position of the photosensitive medium. As the scanning device rotates, this orientation provides for simultaneous scanning of N scan lines. By properly choosing the orientation of the emitting surface of the array relative to the scanning device consecutive horizontal scan lines can be written with a vertical separation smaller than the separation between the lasers of the array. Advantages of these orientations is that the printing speed can be substantially increased up to N times or the rotation speed of the scanning device can be decreased up to a factor of N or any combination thereof while maintaining the same resolvable spots density.",4445125

20791,394176,1980s,"A system for changing the rate of a bit clock based on errors of individual facets of a rotating polygon utilized in laser scanning system, the errors that exist between facets causing the velocity of the scan associated with the facet to be different from other scans. Facet erros are detected initially by having a start of scan pulse initiate a bit clock counter which counts the clock pulses generated by a voltage controlled oscillator. The counter provides an output to an interval detector when a desired total bit count for a scan line is reached. At some time with respect to the counter output an end of scan pulse is generated. The interval between the counter output and the end of scan pulse is the error for a particular facet. Logic allows memory locations to be addressed and loaded with the errors produced by the remaining facets in sequence, the sequence being continually repeated as the polygon rotates. During the time between the end of scan and start of scan pulses for a scan line, the error for the next facet is read out of memory to a digital to analog converter, which changes the frequency of the voltage controlled oscillator. If the error indicates the scan velocity is slow for the next facet, the oscillator frequency is reduced. If the error indicates the scanned velocity is fast for the next facet, the oscillator frequency is increased.",4204233

For good results, the annealing is conducted in an elemental anti-outdiffusion environment or the laser structure to be annealed is encapsulated so that any outdiffusion of laser elemental constituents is discouraged during thermal annealing. In an exemplary illustration of the invention, laser heterostructures of the GaAl/GaAlAs regime are utilized and annealed for several hours in an As environment to selectively reduce the emission wavelength by as much as 200 .ANG. or more. The As environment prevents the outdiffusion of As from the GaAl/GaAlAs heterostructure during thermal annealing, elemental As having the lowest temperature of vaporization of elemental Ga, Al and As. High temperature annealing above this temperature may tend to drive elemental As from the heterostructure thereby changing its operating characteristics. Thermal annealing may be carried out in an annealing furnace, generally sealed in a quartz ampoule, or in a thermal pulse annealing system wherein properly prepared wafer samples may be alternately heated uniformly for prescribed periods of time at predetermined temperatures and periodically checked to determine the amount emission wavelength shift as compared to the set emission wavelength desired to be achieved for the laser.",4585491

The flow regulator comprises an envelope and a regulating member turnably disposed in the flow passage confined by the envelope (11). The torque produced by the flow of gaseous substance on the regulating member and on the other hand a counter-torque dependent on the position of the regulating member cause the regulating member turning in the flow passage to assume a position of equilibrium such that the requisite pressure drop is obtained for maintaining the volumetric flow rate at predetermined magnitude. The range of operation of the flow regulator is changeable by regulating the size, dependent on the different angular positions of the regulating member, of the efective flow aperture between the regulating member and the flow passage. The effective size of the regulating member is changeble in order to change the size of the effective flow aperture.

The ratio of gases in the resultant mixture is automatically determined by the relative volumes and pressures of the charging cylinders, which may be precisely regulated by adjustment of pistons movable within such cylinders and by gas pressure regulation. To safeguard against too rapid voiding of a small volume charging cylinder, voiding of the larger volume cylinder may be initiated first with the aid of a choke downstream of the manifold. This will create an artificial back pressure in the distribution system.",4384632

34085,213495,1980s,"Drilling fluids, both fresh and saline, containing additives and compositions, predominantly nonionic in nature, for the beneficiation of bentonite in such drilling slurries are described. The primary class of compounds employed are ethylene oxide derivatives, nonionic polysaccharides and under certain specified conditions anionic polysaccharides. In fresh water slurries polyethylene glycol derivatives of significantly different molecular weights are employed with nonionic polysaccharides for optimizing the rheological characteristics of bentonite slurries. The anionic polysaccharide can be deleted from the blend for economic reasons. In such formulations (i.e., a polyethylene glycol-nonionic polysaccharide blend) the molecular weight of the polyethylene glycol is important in obtaining low shear-rate yield stress characteristics in fresh water slurries, at elevated temperatures for maximum drill solids carrying capacity within the wellbore. The blend of beneficiating agents affects a decreasing yield stress character with decreasing temperature to permit drill solids removal at ambient surface conditions. In saline solutions polyethylene glycols of intermediate molecular weight (less than 30,000) and nonionic polysaccharides are effective in inhibiting syneresis (i.e., phase separation) and in providing good slurry rheological profiles at elevated temperatures. Anionic polysacchrides are utilized (particularly in saline solutions) to ensure the proper structuring of the bentonite wellbore filter cake for fluid loss control and to ensure optimum rheological characteristics of the slurry with the ternary blend of beneficiating agents at intermediate reservoir temperatures.",4561985

The receiver (Rx) is being tuned through the same frequencies (A-G) at a relatively slower rate so that the sync acquisition signal is received at each of the receiver frequencies. Upon recognition of the sync acquisition signal and the cycle in which it is received, the receiver anticipates the end of the last cycle of the sync acquisition signal in synchronism with the transmitter and initiates tuning of the transmitter and receiver in accordance with a predetermined pseudorandom code. Additionally, a synchronization maintenance signal is sent approximately every ten seconds to insure that the synchronization between both radios is precisely maintained. Upon termination of a transmission, an ""end of message"" signal is sent. Depending upon the radio mode selected, both radios will either simultaneously return to the ""search"" or acquisition mode, in which case resynchronization is required each time the transmitter is keyed, or in which synchronism is retained for a predetermined time (T.sub.3 -T.sub.5 and T.sub.6 -T.sub.7) following transmission to permit receipt of an answer without the necessity of re-establishing synchronism.",4558453

51697,432519,1980s,"In a coincidence vector gate ink jet, a droplet is expressed from an outlet orifice by a coincident pressure produced by a pair of transducers at an outlet orifice. In this type of ink jet, it is normal for one of a cooperating pair of transducers to be activated in a non-coincident mode. In the non-coincident mode, a droplet is not expressed from an outlet orifice as long as the pressure produced by the one transducer remains below a given threshold. A pressure absorbing chamber is provided, which permits this threshold pressure to be sustantially increased to a level substantially above the minimum coincident pressure produced by the pair of transducers to express a droplet from the orifice. This increase in the threshold pressure is an increase in the operating window.

57272,345812,1980s,"In a printer in which drive transistors coupled to hammer drive coils control energization of the coils within each of a plurality of magnetic print hammer actuators to provide firing of hammer springs associated with the print hammer actuators, leakage of one or more of the drive transistors when they are switched off is detected by a testing circuit which flags a fault condition to turn off the driver circuits if the current at a junction common to all of the drive transistors exceeds a predetermined threshold value. This provides an early warning system in which faulty transistors are routinely detected well before they have a chance to fail and thereafter burn out the associated coil included within a hammerbank of the printer. The testing circuit which comprises a resistor and an operational amplifier coupled in parallel between the common junction and a power supply terminal is activated by a transistor switch which responds to a test control microprocessor to repeatedly close and thereby test for transistor leakage as well as possible shorted coils when the printer is not printing. The microprocessor also repeatedly sequences through the drive transistors to momentarily switch each of them on so that the testing circuit can determine that they and the associated hammer drive coils conduct properly by insuring that a current of predetermined minimum value is present at the common junction. A power transistor coupled to provide rapid current rise when the drive transistors are switched on is also tested for leakage using a second testing circuit, when the printer is not printing.",4875409

63904,537354,1980s,"This improved driving force support is used in a linear actuator in which rotary motion of a rotating screw shaft is converted to linear motion of a travelling nut. The driving force support comprises a pair of springs surrounding the rotating shaft and held in compression between a pair of shaft bearing receivers. The receivers and bearings held thereby move axially with the rotating shaft as axial forces are applied to the shaft by the travelling nut. The bearing receivers slide axially in a hollow housing. The springs are arranged in series between seats which normally abut the respective bearing receivers and also normally abut stop surfaces in the housing. One spring has a high degree of stiffness, and the other has a comparatively low degree of stiffness. An intermediate seat between the springs has a projection which abuts the seat on the opposite end of the weaker spring to limit the flexure of the weaker spring, while allowing it to compress as the bearing receivers move axially through a short distance. When the driving force exceeds a predetermined limit, the resulting axial movement of the bearing receivers is detected by a limit switch, which can be used to stop the actuator. During stopping, further rotation of the shaft results in compression of the stronger spring until the rotation stops.",4727762

In another aspect, a rotating device carries the calibration material through the beam. The specific densitometer shown uses an x-ray tube operated at two different voltages to generate a pencil beam, the energy levels of the x-ray photons being a function of the voltage applied. An integrating detector is timed to integrate the detected signal of the patient-attenuated beam over each pulse, the signals are converted to digital values and a digital computer converts the set of values produced by the raster scan into a representation of the bone density of the patient. Multiple reference detectors with differing absorbers are used by the system to continuously correct for variation in voltage and current of the x-ray tube. Calibration is accomplished by the digital computer on the basis of passing the pencil beam through known bone-representing substance as the densitometer scans portions of the patient having bone and adjacent portions having only flesh. A set of detected signals affected by the calibration substance in regions having only flesh is compared by the computer with a set of detected signals unaffected by the calibration material.",4811373

95690,195357,1980s,"In a hydraulic press for briquetting loose powders into green compacts, a load cell senses maximum compacting force. The maximum compacting force is compared with a compacting standard force known to effect a particular weight and density of compacted briquette. There is next operated a closed-loop servo network which adjusts the peak force to the standard force by varying the initial size of the cavity receiving the loose powders. Should the peak force be greater or less than standard force, an actuating mechanism is energized either to enlarge or diminish the die cavity for receiving the powder. If the peak force is too small, the initial die cavity size is enlarged so that a greater amount of powder is charged to the die cavity. The result is that when the final configuration of the briquette is reached, there will be greater density and greater weight to the briquette, causing it to more nearly approximate a standard briquette weight and density. Conversely, the die cavity is automatically initially reduced in the event that compacting maximum force is too great so that the final compacted briquette will contain less powder, thus reducing the density and weight and thereby adjusting the finished product to a standard briquette size and density.",4413967

104416,84488,1980s,"In a spread spectrum communications system employing cyclic code shift keying as its primary modulation, the transmission waveform is spread for transmission security by modulo-2 adding a pseudo-noise sequence to the CCSK data symbols prior to phase modulating onto a carrier signal for transmission. If the transmission modulation is minimum shift keying (MSK) the two components of the data stream are applied to the carrier with a differential encoding step implicit in the modulation scheme. This differential encoding characteristic makes stripping of the PN spread function prior to CCSK demodulation difficult at the receiving end. In order to demodulate this waveform in an optimum manner, an array correlator, the adjacent correlator stages of which have one chip relative time displacements of their CCSK reference waveform, is employed. In effect the array correlator becomes a parallel array of matched filters matched to each cyclic shift of the incoming waveform. By modulo-2 addition of the PN spreading waveform with the time displaced CCSK reference waveform in each stage of the correlator, the correlator can be made to match all versions of the spread symbol being received.",4707839

104605,273809,1980s,"An apparatus in which an electrostatic latent image recorded on a photoconductive member is developed. A supply of developer material comprising at least toner particles and carrier granules is stored and transported closely adjacent to the electrostatic latent image recorded on the photoconductive member. The quantity of developer material being transported to the electrostatic latent image recorded on the photoconductive member is controlled by a metering blade. At least accumulation of toner particles adjacent the blade is prevented and a flow of toner particles away from the blade induced. In this way, the escape of toner particles from the storage chamber thereof is substantially minimized. This invention relates generally to an electrophotographic printing machine, and more particularly to a development system which minimizes the escape of at least the toner particles of the developer material therefrom. In a typical electrophotographic printing machine, a photoconductive member is charged to a substantially uniform potential to sensitize the surface thereof. The charged portion of the photoconductive surface is exposed to a light image of an original document being reproduced. This records an electrostatic latent image on the photoconductive member corresponding to the informational areas contained within the original document. After the electrostatic latent image is recorded on the photoconductive member, the latent image is developed by bringing a developer material into contact therewith. This forms a powder image on the photoconductive member which is subsequently transferred to a copy sheet. Finally, the copy sheet is heated to permanently affix the powder image thereto in image configuration. Generally, the developer material is made from a mixture of carrier granules and toner particles. The toner particles adhere triboelectrically to the carrier granules. This two-component mixture is brought into contact with the latent image. Toner particles are attracted from the carrier granules to the latent image forming a powder image thereof. Hereinbefore, the toner particles contained within the development system frequently escaped therefrom resulting in contamination of the printing machine. This produced degradation of copy quality and frequently resulted in excessive service calls. Moreover, the environment surrounding the various processing stations within the printing machine would invariably become dirty or coated with particles. In the development system, a magnetic brush developer roller transports developer material closely adjacent to the photoconductive surface. A metering blade regulates the thickness of the layer of developer material adhering to the developer roller. It has been found that a fairly thick layer of toner particles forms on the metering blade. The accumulation of toner particles on the metering blade provides a source thereof at least a part of which may escape from the development system resulting in contamination of the surrounding subassemblies within the printing machine. Various techniques have been devised for preventing the escape of toner particles from the development system. The following disclosures appear to be relevant: U.S. Pat.

The centrifugal separator separates the particles from the air and collects the particles in the chamber for subsequent re-use. The air exiting the separator passes through a filter prior to returning to the atmosphere. Bell describes a system for reclaiming residual toner particles removed from a photoreceptor. A blower removes air and toner from a photoreceptor cleaner. The toner is separated from the moving air and stored for re-use with the clean air being vented to the atmosphere. Jugle describes a development system having a filter disposed in a wall thereof and a vacuum system associated therewith for maintaining the chamber of a development system at a negative pressure to prevent the escape of particles therefrom. The developer material flows over the filter and cleans particles therefrom.
